# Financial Planner API Homework
<hr />
Per the directions in the homework assignment (<a href="https://nu.bootcampcontent.com/NU-Coding-Bootcamp/nu-chi-virt-fin-pt-04-2021-u-c/tree/master/05-APIs/Homework" target="blank">click here to view</a>), I created a new repository and README.md file to submit the homework to.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
In this repository, you will find my assignment saved as a Jupyter Notebook (Personal_Finance_Planner.ipynb), as well as the MCForecastTools.py file.

# NOTE:  I did not include my personal API keys!
